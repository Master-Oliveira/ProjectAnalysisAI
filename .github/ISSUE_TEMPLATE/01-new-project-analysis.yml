        ## Request a New Project Analysis
        
        Use this template to request a comprehensive analysis of a project. The analysis will generate an **As-Is document** that captures the current state of the project including:
        - Project information (owner, tech lead, description, use cases)
        - Technical details (technologies, versions, architecture)
        - Dependencies (databases, queues, external integrations)
        - Communication matrix (servers, ports, connections)
        
        This document will be used as a baseline for migration planning to GitHub and Azure Cloud.

        ### For the AI Agent
        
        **Task**: Generate a comprehensive As-Is document for the specified project.
        
        **Steps**:
        1. Locate the project files in `mcp/bitbucket/<project-code>` or the specified location
        2. Analyze all code, configuration files, and dependencies
        3. Cross-reference with `mcp/config-manager` if needed
        4. Follow the structure defined in `docs/how-to-document.md` for As-Is documents
        5. Create the document in Markdown format in the `docs/` folder as `<project-code>-as-is.md`
        6. Ensure the document is non-technical and suitable for architects and business stakeholders
        
        **Acceptance Criteria**:
        - [ ] As-Is document created at `docs/<project-code>-as-is.md`
        - [ ] Document includes all required sections: Project Information, Technical Details, Dependencies, Communication Matrix
        - [ ] All technologies are listed with versions
        - [ ] All dependencies are clearly identified with connection details
        - [ ] Communication matrix includes sources, destinations, ports, and protocols
        - [ ] Document is written in non-technical language suitable for business audiences
        - [ ] Document follows Markdown format for Confluence compatibility
