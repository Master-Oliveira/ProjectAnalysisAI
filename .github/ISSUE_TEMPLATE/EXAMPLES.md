## Example 3: Migration Strategy Question

**Scenario:** You're unsure whether to use Azure SQL Database or keep using containers with PostgreSQL for your project.

**Template to use:** üí° Migration Strategy Question

**How to fill it out:**
- **Question Category:** Azure Services Selection
- **Related Project Code:** OPS-001 (optional)
- **Your Question:** Should I migrate from Oracle to Azure SQL Database or use PostgreSQL in containers on AKS for better cost control?
- **Current Situation:**
  - Using Oracle 19c (expensive licensing)
  - 500GB database size
  - OLTP workload with ~1000 transactions/second
  - Need ACID compliance
  - Team has PostgreSQL experience
- **Desired Outcome:**
  - Reduce database licensing costs
  - Maintain or improve performance
  - Flexibility to scale
  - Minimize migration effort
- **Urgency:** Medium - Needed for upcoming work
- **Research Done:** (check all that apply)
  - Searched existing documentation
  - Reviewed Azure documentation
  - Consulted with team members

**Expected Outcome:** Detailed comparison of options with pros/cons, cost analysis, migration effort, and recommendation.

## Example 4: Document Update Request

**Scenario:** The OPS-001 project recently added a new integration with a shipping provider API, and the As-Is document needs to be updated.

**Template to use:** üìù Update Existing Document

**How to fill it out:**
- **Project Code:** OPS-001
- **Document Type:** As-Is Document
- **Document Location:** docs/OPS-001-as-is.md
- **Reason for Update:** Project changes (new features, architecture changes)
- **Changes Needed:**
  - Add new dependency: ShipFast API integration
  - Update communication matrix with new API endpoint
  - Add authentication details (API key via Azure Key Vault)
  - Update architecture diagram to show new integration
- **Current Content:** (copy relevant section)
  ```
  Dependencies:
  - Oracle Database (server: db-prod-01:1521)
  - RabbitMQ (server: mq-prod-01:5672)
  - Payment Gateway API (https://api.payments.com)
  ```
- **Desired Content:**
  ```
  Dependencies:
  - Oracle Database (server: db-prod-01:1521)
  - RabbitMQ (server: mq-prod-01:5672)
  - Payment Gateway API (https://api.payments.com)
  - ShipFast Shipping API (https://api.shipfast.com/v2)
    - Authentication: API Key (stored in Azure Key Vault)
    - Used for: Real-time shipping quotes and label generation
  ```
- **Priority:** Medium - Important for accuracy
- **Context:** Integration went live last week, need documentation updated before migration planning continues

## Tips for Success

### General Best Practices
1. **Be Specific:** The more detail you provide, the better the outcome
2. **Use Standard Format:** Always use XXX-NNN format for project codes
3. **Check Existing Issues:** Search for similar issues before creating new ones
4. **Provide Context:** Explain why the analysis/question is important
5. **Set Realistic Timelines:** Be honest about urgency and deadlines

### For Project Analysis Requests
- Include links to any existing documentation
- List all known dependencies, even if uncertain
- Provide access credentials locations (don't include actual credentials!)
- Mention any special considerations or constraints

### For Questions
- Show what you've already researched
- Include specific scenarios or examples
- Ask one focused question rather than multiple unrelated questions
- Provide context about your project's unique requirements

### For Document Updates
- Reference specific sections that need changes
- Provide both current and desired content when possible
- Explain why the update is needed
- Indicate urgency relative to other work

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario A: Starting a New Migration
1. Create issue with "New Project Analysis" template ‚Üí Get As-Is document
2. Create issue with "To-Be Document" template ‚Üí Get migration plan
3. Use "Migration Strategy Question" for specific technical decisions
4. Use "Update Document" as project evolves

### Scenario B: Quick Question
1. Use "Migration Strategy Question" template directly
2. Provide context about your situation
3. Get expert guidance without full analysis

### Scenario C: Maintaining Documentation
1. Use "Update Document" template when project changes
2. Keep As-Is and To-Be documents synchronized
3. Document new integrations and dependencies promptly

### Scenario D: Multiple Projects
1. Create separate issues for each project code
2. Use labels to filter and organize
3. Reference related projects in "Additional Context" fields
4. Cross-reference documents when projects have dependencies
